# A Monster Issue

###Â Writeup by tritoke, 100 Points

`Agent,`

`We've got a case of industrial espionage, quite an unusual one at that. An international building contractor - Hamilton-Lowe, has written to us that they are having their private client contracts leaked.`

`After conducting initial incident response, they managed to find a hidden directory on one of their public facing web-servers. However, the strange thing is, instead of having any sensitive documents, it was full of mp3 music files.`

`This is a serious affair as Hamilton-Lowe constructs facilities for high-profile clients such as the military, which means having building schematics leaked from them could lead to a lapse in national security.`

`We have attached one of these mp3 files, can you examine it and see if there is any hidden information inside?`

To start with this challenge we are give a ``mp3`` file: ``aero_chord.mp3``
Listening to the track nothing particularly seems to be off about it.
This lead me to running ``binwalk`` on the binary:

```
$ binwalk -Me aero_chord.mp3

This reveals two new files, ``OwO.wav`` and ``2BF04.zip``.
``2BF04.zip`` has a password so we can't open it yet, but we can look at ``OwO.wav``.
Listening to it and it sounds very odd, kind of like lots of beeps?
So I opened it up in audacity, and looked at the spectrogram:

This reveals the password ``Shad0ws``.
We can now use this password to open ``2BF04`` and get the flag:

```
7z e 2BF04.zip
```

## Flag: ractf{M0nst3rcat_In5tin3t}
