The first thing to note about this one, that I actually noticed as I was copying it into the analyzer, is the absence of any `J`s. This is a classic indicator of the use of a polybius square, where I and J is treated as the same character. Based on the difficulty level of 04, I was going into this thinking it would be either a Playfair or Bifid cipher - the two most common which use a polybius square. I'm using my script based on the ACA reference statistics, found in `cipher_stats.py`, which will compare the statistics of a given ciphertext to the ACA references and give a likelihood rank to each possible cipher type. Here are the top few options (smaller number is better):

```
Bifid 4.29
Seriated Playfair 5.1
CM Bifid 6.01
```

As expected, it's likely a bifid. CM (Conjugated Matrix) Bifid is effectively double bifid, using two key squares, which greatly increases the keyspace. Seriated Playfair is a similarly obscure cipher which includes a bifid-like *seiration* step, i.e. a step where text is split up into periodic chunks, effectively adding a transposition layer and breaking up critical elements of the ciphertext that could be used for cryptanalysis. Both of these are more difficult and more obscure than the standard Bifid, so we'll assume it's this.

We're going to have to use some more sophisticated attack strategies now, using a Simulated Annealing optimizer to locate the key. A common method for breaking simple substitution ciphers is hill climbing, which could be represented in python as follows:
```python
def hill_climb(ciphertext, iterations):
	best_key = ""
	best_score = 1e99
	best_plaintext = ""
	for i in iterations:
		# use a mutation function to make a small change to the key
		# e.g. swapping a letter
		temp_key = mutate(best_key)
		# decode the ciphertext with temp_key
		temp_plaintext = decode(ciphertext, temp_key)
		# score the result (assuming a smaller-is-better approach)
		temp_score = score(temp_plaintext)
		if temp_score < best_score:
			best_score = temp_score
			best_key = temp_key
			best_plaintext = temp_plaintext
	return best_plaintext
```
This is great, but it assumes that any key closer to the target will yield a plaintext with a better score. This can be mitigated by using a strong scoring function, like quadgram markov scoring, but it fundamentally assumes that the function mapping a key to a score is convex, and that there are no local maxima it could get stuck in. This is broadly true for a substitution cipher, but not for a digraphic one like Playfair or Bifid. So here is where we need simulated annealing. The basic principle is to, unlike hill climbing, decide probabilistically whether we accept a child key, rather than deterministically. What's crucial is how that randomisation is done. Without getting too involved, we define a simulated annealing scheme by three functions:
$$E(k) : S \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$$
Where S is the keyspace, the set of all possibilities. This is the cost function (denoted $E$ for "energy function", as the goal of thermal annealing is to minimise internal energies in a metal), which assigns every member of the search space $S$ a real-valued cost. In our case, this is simply `E(key) = score(decrypt(key))`, i.e. as we want to minimise how far away from english the plaintext which this key generates. Next is
$$T(t) : \mathbf{N} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$$
This is the temperature function, which accepts an input of `time`, in our case the current iteration of the program, and outputs a real-valued `temperature` - more on that later. And lastly:
$$P(E_0, E_1, T) : \mathbf{R}^3 \rightarrow [0,1]$$
The acceptance probability function, which is arguably the most important. This takes in $E_0, E_1$, the function $E$ evaluated at two different points, and $T$, the current temperature (as given by $T(t)$, with $t$ being the current time). 

The principle of simulated annealing, which has a very involved proof, is to do the same as a hill climb, except accept "worse" child keys with some probability, given by $P$, which decreases as time goes on, and depends on how bad the child key is in comparison to the parent. Our time-dependent variable is temperature, which we want to "cool" as time goes on. Let's write the simplest possible temperature function as it will be good enough for us:
```python
def T(time):
	return START_TEMP - (COOLING_RATE * time)
```
Now, we can consider how we define $P$. For the same $E_0,E_1$ - $E$ evaluated on the parent key and current child key respectively, we want it to return a smaller probability as time goes on, so we know that we want to make a smaller `temperature` yield a smaller return value. Similarly, for the same $T$, but an $E_1 >> E_0$, we want it to return a small probability, so let's make it such that it decreases the bigger $E_1$ is compared to $E_0$. With quite a lot of maths, but I think also very intuitively, it turns out that the optimal function $P$ to use in most situations is:
$$ P(E_0, E_1, T) = e^{\frac{E_0 - E_1}{T}},  \forall T > 0$$

We can see how this satisfies all our conditions: if $E_1 < E_0$, the exponent is positive => the function returns a value > 1, otherwise the greater $T$ is and the closer together $E_1$ and $E_0$ are, the closer the exponent will be to zero => the closer the value returned will be to 1. In python:
```python
def P(e0, e1, T):
	if e1 < e0:
		return 1.1
	if T <= 0:
		return 0
	return math.exp( (e0 - e1) / T )
```

Note we've added two bailouts here so we don't have to compute massive exponents or accidentally divide by 0 or a negative value.

Now let's adapt our hill-climbing code from before to include our new-found knowledge!

```python
def simulated_annealing(ciphertext, iterations):
	best_key = ""
	best_score = 1e99
	best_plaintext = ""
	for i in range(iterations):
		# use a mutation function to make a small change to the key
		# e.g. swapping a letter
		temp_key = mutate(best_key)
		# decode the ciphertext with temp_key
		temp_plaintext = decode(ciphertext, temp_key)
		# score the result (assuming a smaller-is-better approach)
		temp_score = score(temp_plaintext)
		# apply the simulated annealing
		if P(best_score, temp_score, T(i)) > random.random():
			best_score = temp_score
			best_key = temp_key
			best_plaintext = temp_plaintext
	return best_plaintext
```
Choosing the best temperature parameters is a little tricky, but I generally have good results with `START_TEMP = 10, COOLING_RATE=0.00001` and around 100,000 iterations.

At last, let's talk Bifid. One of the extra bits of cryptanalysis we need to do is to find the period. We can sometimes get good results by looking at the bigram variance in the ciphertext of bigrams of different period. The variance should exhibit a spike when we look at bigrams with a period equal to the cipher period. Let's write some python to test this:
```python
import statistics

def find_bifid_period(ciphertext):
    possible_periods = []
    for period in range(1, 21):
        counts = {}
        for i in range(len(ciphertext)):
            bigram = ciphertext[i] + ciphertext[(i + period) % len(ciphertext)]
            try:
                counts[bigram] += 1
            except KeyError:
                counts[bigram] = 1
        possible_periods.append([period, statistics.variance(counts.values())])

    return sorted(possible_periods, key = lambda e : e[1], reverse=True)

ct = "..."
print(find_bifid_period(ct)[:10])
```
```
[20, 0.6563738861611201]
[12, 0.5968379446640316]
[2, 0.5860576205403792]

[5, 0.5196217494089834]
[8, 0.5087866108786611]
```
Unfortunately, there's no clear spike here, so we'll work systematically through the top 10 possible periods with our simulated annealing solver. Let's write a python function for bifid decryption:

```python
def decrypt_bifid(ciphertext, key, period):
    # compute keysquare indices for efficiency
    indices = {}
    characters = {}
    for i,c in enumerate(key):
        indices[c] = str(i//5) +  str(i%5)
        characters[str(i//5) +  str(i%5)] = c
    # pad with spaces
    ciphertext += ' ' * (len(ciphertext) % period)
    # chunk ciphertext
    ciphertext_chunks = [ciphertext[i : i + period] for i in range(0, len(ciphertext), period)]

    # decrypt
    plaintext = ""
    for chunk in ciphertext_chunks:
        # write out row
        row = "".join([indices[c] for c in chunk.replace(" ", "")])
        for i in range(len(row)//2):
            # read off letters column-wise
            plaintext += characters[row[i] + row[i + len(row)//2]]

    return plaintext
```
And now we can throw this into the simulated annealing code we wrote earlier! I used a simple letter-swapping function for the key mutator and the quadgram scorer from my PyKrak python package. The full code is in `solve_bifid.py`. We let the script run for a bit with a few different periods, and then on period 5 we get:
