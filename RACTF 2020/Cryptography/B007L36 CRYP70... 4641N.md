As you continue your pentest of MEGACORP, you make your way to an admin-only subnet of the network. There, you find yet another custom crypto implementation. You also previously found this zip file on a user's desktop. Solving this may be the last step to gaining full access to the company's network
`

This is part 2 of the encryption reverse engineering challenges for RACTF 2020. Once again, we have a web service to connect to, but this time a zip which contains 3 files:

plaintext.txt
```
To test the encryption service, encrypt this file with your company issued secret key and ensure that it results in the ciphertext.txt file.
```
ciphertext.txt
```

From the looks of things, we're going to need to use a known-plaintext attack against `plaintext.txt` and `ciphertext.txt`, and then use retrieved information to decode `password.txt`, which likely holds the flag

Let's see what the TCP service gives us:
```
Welcome MEGACORP admin! Feel free to encrypt any sensitive information using this service to protect against data theft.

Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: A
Your encrypted message is: woI=
```
Another encryption oracle! This time we have to provide a message and a key. Let's try a few things:
```
Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: ABAB
Your encrypted message is: woLCg8KCwoM=

Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: AAAA
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: ABAB
Your encrypted message is: woLCg8KCwoM=
```
Our first observation then is that the key will be repeated to match the length of the plaintext being encrypted. My first thought then is that this is some sort of XOR-based encryption. Let's see if it matters which string is the key and which string is the plaintext:
```
Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: ABAB
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: AAAA
Your encrypted message is: woLCg8KCwoM=
```
Exactly the same. So it seems that whilst this might not be XOR-based necessarily, its definitely based on a commutative encryption operation. My suspicion then is whether the operation is linear, so let's test that now:
```
Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: B
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: C
Your encrypted message is: woU=

Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: D
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: A
Your encrypted message is: woU=
```
It is! So just like before, if the characters have the same sum, the same ciphertext will be yielded. Let's decode the base64 to check whether it's operating on characters individually like before:
```
 Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: A
Your encrypted message is: woI=
c2 82

Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: B
Your encrypted message is: woM=
c2 83

Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: ABA
Your encrypted message is: woLCg8KC
c2 82 c2 83 c2 82
```
So it looks like it is! My initial thought on seeing this was that if `c2 82` corresponds to `A` and `c2 83` corresponds to `B` then maybe we have something linear again. But that wouldn't explain, for example:
```
Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: k
Your encrypted message is: wqw=
c2 ac

Please enter the secret key to encrypt the data with: A
Please enter the data that you would like to encrypt: 0
Your encrypted message is: cQ==
71
```
My initial idea was that sums were grouped into chunks, and sums in those chunks being encrypted with an optional start byte indicating the chunk followed by a second byte indicating the position in that chunk. However, this was a very difficult system to reverse engineer, and the variable ciphertext length per character meant that a parser would be difficult. What I realised, however, is that there is a very small number of possible sums - from 64 being a space + a space at the minimum to 252 being a tilde + a tilde at the maximum. If I could write a script to pull the encryption of all possible character pairs, I could use the same approach as in the Snakes and Ladders challenge. I used pwntools to send requests to encrypt all ascii printable chars with a key of a space, followed by requests to encrypt all ascii printable chars with a key of a tilde, which hit all 188 possible sums. I then saved these in a list, and moved it over to a separate script which would actually do the attack.
```python
ciphertexts = [...]

# utilities after loading in the base64 encoded ciphertext bytes
import base64
cipher_bytes = [base64.b64decode(s[1:]) for s in ciphertexts]
all_chars = "".join([chr(i) for i in range(32,127)])

def encipher(plain, key):
    # repeat the key as the actual client would do
    key = key * ((len(key)//len(plain)) + 1)
    
    ret = b''
    # enumerate characters
    for i,c in enumerate(plain):
        # as the minimum sum is 64, this is what the 0th list element
        # refers to
        ret += cipher_bytes[(ord(c) + ord(key[i])) - 64]
    
    # finish encryption
    return base64.b64encode(ret)

# contents of plaintext.txt
plaintext = "..."
# contents of ciphertext.txt
ciphertext = "..."
```
Whereas in the last one we bruteforced the flag directly, this time we need to start by figuring out the key. As we have a sample plaintext and a sample ciphertext, we can use a simple known-plaintext attack to recover the key:

```python
c_bytes = base64.b64decode(ciphertext)
current_key = ""

# here is where we bruteforce the key character by character,
# encoding a substring of the plaintext and checking against a
# substring of the ciphertext as before
while len(current_key) < len(plaintext):
    for c in all_chars:
        t_enc = base64.b64decode(encipher(plaintext[:len(current_key) + 1], current_key + c))
        if c_bytes[:len(t_enc)] == t_enc:
            current_key += c
            print (current_key)
            break
```
Running this yields the key as:
```
ractf{n0t_th3_fl49_y3t}
```
The program actually kept running much further than this, repeating this string up until the length of the plaintext. Now we know the key, we can perform the same attack one last time against the `password.txt` file. It would be possible to do this analytically, but this is simpler to implement as it doesn't mean having to deal with variable length ciphertext characters

```python
secret = "..."
s_bytes = base64.b64decode(secret)

current_password = ""
while current_password == "" or encipher(current_password, current_key).decode() != secret:
    for c in all_chars:
        t_enc = base64.b64decode(encipher(current_password + c, current_key))
        if s_bytes[:len(t_enc)] == t_enc:
            current_password += c
            print (current_password)
            break
```
Running this gives us:
```
r
ra
rac
ract
ractf
ractf{
ractf{f
ractf{f0
ractf{f00
ractf{f00l
ractf{f00l_
ractf{f00l_m
ractf{f00l_m3
ractf{f00l_m3_
ractf{f00l_m3_7
ractf{f00l_m3_7w
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_0
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_0n
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_0n_
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_0n_m
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_0n_m3
ractf{f00l_m3_7w1c3_5h4m3_0n_m3}
```
And we have the flag.
