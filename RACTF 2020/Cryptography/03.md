First step, as always, is to check the cipher statistics. I'm using my script based on the ACA reference statistics, found in `cipher_stats.py`, which will compare the statistics of a given ciphertext to the ACA references and give a likelihood rank to each possible cipher type. Here are the top few options (smaller number is better):
```
Myszkowski 2.85
Cadenus 3.42
Nihilist Transp 3.51
Swagman 3.55
Columnar 3.56
Redefence 3.97
Railfence 3.97
Route Transp 4.02
```

It's quite clearly a transposition cipher, which we can verify with some frequency analysis, so let's pick the easiest of these to get started with. Myszkowski, Cadenus, Nihilist Transp and Swagman are all very uncommon, and Route Transposition, although popular in puzzles, is rarely used in a classical crypto challenge because of how guess-y it is, so our most likely candidates are Redefence, Railfence or Columnar. Redefence is also known as Keyed Railfence, where a transposition is applied to the railfence rows, and has almost identitical statistics to the Railfence.  Being the caesar cipher of the transpositions, we can easily bruteforce the keys to a railfence, so we'll start with this one. [dcode](http://dcode.fr) does it for us, and we find it is a Railfence with period 5.
The text tells us the flag, and we're done with `ractf{anualleave}`
