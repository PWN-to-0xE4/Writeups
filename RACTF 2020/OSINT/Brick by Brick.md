The image has two flags. One of them is the [Estelada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelada), a flag flown by Catalan nationalists, and the other one is the flag of Catalonia. This means that the location is narrowed to the Spanish region of Catalonia. Catalonia has 4 main provinces, each with their respective capital cities: Barcelona (the capital of the region), Girona, Lleida and Tarragona.

However, this is irrelevant, as a reverse image search using Google identifies the structure as the Romanesque Bridge of [Besal√∫](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besal%C3%BA).

**NOTE:** This challenge's flag is submitted after selection on a map and is hence not explicit.
