`Agent, it's good to have you.`

`One of our targets has been constantly avoiding us, but we managed to find their private Instagram. They just posted a photo, but we can't work out where they are. We tried to check the EXIF data, but it appears the social platform removes it automatically.`

`Let us know where he is by clicking on the map, you'll have to be accurate to within 500 meters!`

In the background, we can see the logo of the HAKA Creperie. A quick Google search reveals this to be in Morzine, France, and we can get its coordinates easily from Google Maps. Pasting this into the map and zooming in to click on the rough area gives us the flag!

**NOTE:** This challenge's flag is submitted after selection on a map and is hence not explicit.
