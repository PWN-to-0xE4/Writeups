`Aargh! They gave us the slip again. We got another image from their Twitter, but it doesn't look like they're in the same country anymore. Are you able to track them down again for us and tell us the town they're in? You're our best man at this point, so we're expecting great things.`

`Our map here should be accurate to 500 meters.`

In the background, you can see the writing on the buildings looks to be a script very similar to Thai - the medallions represented on the graves look to be of a military design, and a Google Images search for "Thailand War Cemetery" gives an image for the `Kanchanaburi War Cemetery`, which looks identical to the photo. 

Finding its location on Google Maps and providing the link, zooming it and clicking the area as per previous challenges provides us with the flag!
