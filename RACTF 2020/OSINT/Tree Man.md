# Tree Man

### Writeup by Segway, 300 points

`I'm so glad we've got you on the team; I don't think we'd have manged to get that last one if it weren't for you. We've been watching the account, and the target just posted another image. This guy really doesn't learn. We don't think he's left Spain yet, but we really need this one pinpointed exactly. Can you work where he took this? `

`The map here should be accurate to 50 meters.`

This challenge is a continuation of the Brick by Brick, as the challenge mentions that the location in the picture is still in Spain.

However, this is irrelevant, since doing a reverse image search with `tree man` as the search query and looking at visually similar images leads us to this [page](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-image-tree-man-doll-park-portaventura-hdr-shot-spain-salou-image90428890), which identifies the statue as being in PortAventura, an amusement park in Spain.

However, due to the 50 metre accuracy, we need to pinpoint the statue's location in the park. From the image, we can see that the statue is near a body of water, and standing on a wooden platform.

Using satelite imagery, we can locate a wooden platform at `41.08593,1.15445`.
