Cardi B okrrrrrrr!!!

If you reversed in radare2 (or ida etc)

You see the control flow follows as such:

First you input:

okrrrrrrr

Next you input two numbers that are separated by a space which:

--> Add together to make 0x88 (136)
--> Multiply together to make 0xec7 (3783)

Using a simple prime factorisation website we figure out the prime factors are:

3 x 13 x 97

So the two numbers are 39 & 97
